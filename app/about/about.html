                    Andy and Emily met in the summer of 2012 while spending time with a group of mutual
friends, and almost immediately after meeting became inseparable!  Just a few short
months later, they moved in together and created a welcoming home where they enjoy
hosting friends and family. Andy proposed on August 29th 2014, and they are looking
forward to seeing all their closest family and friends in May 2016!
